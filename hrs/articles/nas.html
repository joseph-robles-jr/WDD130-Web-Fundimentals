        <p>Hello, I am Joseph Robles. I love chasing down technical projects and learning something new from them. This site was designed to showcase my personal projects in such a way that everyone could learn something new. My interests tend to center around computing, basic DC electronics, and amateur radio. As such, most of my projects will center around these subjects.</p>

            <h3>AllstarLink Node</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite projects that I have completed so far is my Allstar node. Allstar is a Radio Over Internet Protocol program that allows radios to communicate over a network, A lot like making phone calls but between different radios. Building this node was a big project And I learned a lot</p>
